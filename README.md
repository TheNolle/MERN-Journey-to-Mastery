# Form REACTJS to MERN Mastery: A Developer's journey

This repository showcases my journey in learning MERN Stack development (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) and aims to serve as an informative guide for others who want to become MERN Stack developers. The MERN Stack is a popular technology stack for building full-stack web applications. It consists of MongoDB, a NoSQL database; ExpressJS, a web application framework for NodeJS; ReactJS, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces; and NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment.

Starting with ReactJS and moving through the MERN Stack, I will complete a series of 10 projects to put my newfound knowledge into practice. Each project focuses on specific aspects of the MERN Stack and builds upon the skills I've learned in the previous projects. As I progress through my learning journey, I will include a tutorial in each project's README to explain the concepts and technologies I've learned and applied in that project.
